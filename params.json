{"body":"### Why\r\nIt is time to version control and share (with my different machines and whoever else wants to peek)!\r\n\r\n### How I did set it up\r\nI decided to follow the _detached worktree_ approach.\r\nThis means that I have somewhere a directory which is the git repository for my dotfiles.\r\nThis directory is *NOT* my HOME, there are no symlinks or installation script.\r\n\r\nI have it at `$HOME/git/dotfiles.git`.\r\nAnd I have an alias for git commands when I have to manage it, `home`, which stands for:\r\n```\r\n$ alias home\r\nalias home='git --work-tree=/Users/espin --git-dir=/Users/espin/git/dotfiles.git'\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo when I want to add a new dotfile in my $HOME, I issue:\r\n```\r\n$ home add .newdotfile\r\n$ home commit -m \"a new dotfile\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How to replicate on another machine\r\nsee http://silas.sewell.org/blog/2009/03/08/profile-management-with-git-and-github/ ","tagline":"version control my personal dotfiles","note":"Don't delete this file!
