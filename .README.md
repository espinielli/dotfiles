# My Zone #

I version control my (development) enviroment, see [Setup](#setup) section for the hows,
and have done so to be able to install other machines in a controlled way.

The software I need is typically installed via [Homebrew][brew].

I store the instructions to do so in the respective files, `.brew-list`, `.pip-list`,
`.gem-list`, while for OSX configuration I adopted/copied from
[Mathias Bynens][mathias]'s excellent repo, i.e. `.osx`.


## homebrew ##
The [package manager for MacOS][brew].
Packages and casks are in `$HOME/.brew`.

## Solarized ##
* For Linux I used these [.Xresources][xres]
* For OSX I followed [these instructions][osxsol]


# <a name="setup"></a> Dotfiles et. Co. Setup #
Everything (well almost) is under version control in GitHub.

And a lot is inspired by [Mathias Bynens' dotfiles][mathias].

I use the [detached work tree approach][worktree]
whereby I keep my GIT repo away from my HOME directory.
See also [here][otherdwt].


## <a id="ignoring"> ignoring ##
The following is expecially needed for a dotfiles repo

* setup what to ignore:

        $ cd $HOME
        $ cat <<EOF
        # ignore all by default
        #/*
        # specific ignores
        .DS_Store
        *.pyc
        node_modules
        # do not ignore:
        !bin/
        EOF > $HOME/.gitignore_global

* and add it to the global git config in $HOME

        $ git config --global core.excludesfile $HOME/.gitignore_global


## Initial Setup: put your dotfiles under git ##
I got inspired by [this post][worktreeblog] and this is how I did it:

* create your git repo

        $ cd $HOME
        $ mkdir -p $HOME/.dotfiles

* make an alias, `home`, to manage this special repo

        $ echo "alias home='git --git-dir=$HOME/.dotfiles/ --work-tree=$HOME'" >> $HOME/.zshrc
        $ source $HOME/.zshrc

* init the repo and start adding dotfiles

        $ home init
        $ home add $HOME/.bash_profile $HOME/.bashrc $HOME/.bash_aliases
        $ home commit -m 'Initial commit'
        $ home remote add origin git@github.com:espinielli/.dotfiles
        $ home push origin master


## <a id="cloning"> set it up on a second/third/... machine ##
Now to use (and contribute) from a different machine

* backup your existing dot files
* clone the repo

        $ cd $HOME
        $ git clone https://github.com/espinielli/dotfiles.git /tmp/dotfiles.git

* move git repo configuration info in `$HOME/.dotfiles/`

        $ mv /tmp/dotfiles.git/.git $HOME/.dotfiles/

* enable `dotglob` and copy the dot files to `$HOME`

        $ setopt -s dotglob
        $ mv -i /tmp/dotfiles.git/* $HOME

Finally properly configure what to ignore, see the ['ignoring' section](#ignoring) above.

Use `home ls-files` to list the version controlled dotfiles.
