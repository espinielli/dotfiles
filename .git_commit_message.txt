# Are there side effects or other unintuitive consequences of this
# change? Here's the place to explain them.

#Further paragraphs come after blank lines.
#
# - Bullet points are okay, too
#
# - Typically a hyphen or asterisk is used for the bullet, preceded
#   by a single space, with blank lines in between, but conventions
#   vary here
